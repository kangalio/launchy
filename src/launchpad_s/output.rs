# Double buffering
To make more economical use of data, the Launchpad has a feature called double buffering.
Essentially, Launchpad manages two sets of LED data - buffers - for each pad. By default, these
are configured so that the buffer that is updated by incoming MIDI messages is the same as the
one that is visible, so that note-on messages immediately change their respective pads. However,
the buffers can also be configured so that Launchpadâ€™s LED status is updated invisibly. With a
single command, these buffers can then be swapped. The pads will instantly update to show their
pre-programmed state, while the pads can again be updated invisibly ready for the next swap. The
visible buffer can alternatively be configured to swap automatically at 280ms intervals in order
to configure LEDs to flash.
